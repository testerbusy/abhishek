	 * Advantage of Method Overloading
	 * Method overloading increases the readability of the program
	 * Different ways to overload the method
	 * 1. By changing number of argument
	 * 2. By changing the data types
	 * 
	 * Main method will not able to override
	 * main method will able to overload it, but not able to execute it
